So I have this branch apparently. Months ago I filed the below issue, seemingly
without actually committing the code in question to this branch. Need to do my
best to recreate it and the bug I was seeing.

https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1114

Then check out the proposed solution and see if the ergonomics are good.

Oh and update to latest Zig.

Oh and this time actually compile the dang code to see if the Zig or LLVM IR is
the way I think it is. Come on Jacob, you're a big boy.
